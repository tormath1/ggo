This is a sunday project. Please don't judge me.

I was looking for a simple project in order to take a break with my others on-going projects. That's why I decided to write all GNU commands in go.

### Getting started

#### Build from sources

Make sure that `go` is installed on your machine.

```
$ cd ggo/
$ go build -o ggo main.go
$ sudo mv ggo /usr/local/bin
$ ggo version
GG GNU Golang v0.1 -- HEAD
```

##### Download resources

You can download [latest](https://github.com/tormath1/ggo/releases) release or a specific version.
