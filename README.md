This is a sunday project. Please don't judge me. 

I was looking for a simple project in order to take a break with my others on-going project. That's why I decided to write all GNU commands in go. 

### Getting started

#### Build from sources

Make sure that `go` is installed on your machine.

```
$ cd gg/
$ go build -o gg main.go
$ sudo mv gg /usr/local/bin
$ gg version
GG GNU Golang v0.1 -- HEAD
```
